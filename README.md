# Generative AI Project

Most of these project are designed to be run on Google Colab. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**
   - Open any file you want in this repository, there will be a link I have shared and you just click on it.

2. **Run All Cells**
   - Some project require openai key (or you can change it into another model), you just need register and get api_key from 'https://platform.openai.com/api-keys' then paste it
   - Select `Run all` or manual run one by one

3. **Access the Application**

   - After running all cells, you should see an output message similar to this:
     ```
     Running on public URL: https://XXXXXX.gradio.app
     ```
   - Click on the provided public URL to access the application.

## Notes

- Ensure that you are logged into your Google account to access Google Colab.
- If you encounter any errors, restart the runtime and try running the cells again.
- The notebook uses Gradio (or a similar framework) to host the application, so the link will be generated dynamically during runtime.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues:** If the public URL does not work, check the output logs for errors or try re-running the notebook.
- **Dependencies:** All required libraries will be installed automatically within the notebook. If an installation step fails, re-run the corresponding cell manually.


Enjoy using the application!
